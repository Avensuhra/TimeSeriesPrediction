# TimeSeriesPrediction
This repository is the code base for the Bachelor's thesis 'Financial Time Series Prediction using the Sparse Grids Library SG++'.

# ToDo's:
1. Create simple tutorial grids
2. Rebuild the reference paper grid and cross-check results
3. Build automatic result visualization
4. Create .csv file reader for time series {low, high, open, close, adjusted close, volume}
5. Create Pipeline for Financial Time Series (input, grid, output)
6. Check Pipeline for Financial Time Series
7. Test for possible correlations between the different input streams from 2.
8. Improve the prediction
